            Routes in composition that I think about applied to Web API could also
            be helpful for CLI. For example POST /account/auth { name: "stan",
            password: "!qa2WS3eD" } is the same as "sdd account auth --name stan
            --password !qa2Ws3eD".

            Commands could be loaded automatically from any assemblies. CLI itself
            may be like a basic tool.

            Can CLI commands be exposed automatically as Powershell cmdlets?
